<strong class="smalltitle">Concept</strong> <br>

<p class="bodytext"> I created a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en">chrome extension</a>
	that focuses as an intervention/strategy for online compulsive buyers to assist them with their decision-making. It will prevent buyers from making impulsive purchases</p><br>


<strong class="smalltitle">Designing for the Impulse Buyer</strong>


	<p class="bodytext">When shopping alone online, no one tells you to think before you buy. Online stores
		such as Amazon have the quickest process from adding an item to your cart, typing your shipping information, and hitting submit.
		Amazon even added <a href="https://amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201889620"-> 1-Click Ordering</a> to make this easy. Online stores like this are not thinking of consumer needs, they are making the buying process
		QUICK so the consumer does not even have time to think. With this, my goal is to focus on the consumer or customer needs and assist them with
		making good choices through online interfaces that are too quick.<br><br>

		How can I make impulse buyers stop and think before they buy?<br>
		How can I design an interface that that is not intrusive to their every day lives? <br>	<br><br>

<strong class="smalltitle">Rapid Prototyping</strong> <br>
<p class="bodytext">Each of these prototypes were created and tested with people of different ages to find out the best
	way to make a decision while online shopping. Each of these are simple decision making methods, such as pros and cons, putting the items in order from least favorite to most, etc.
	When the user goes to their cart and clicks to pay, these interventions will show as a pop up.

<strong class="smalltitle">Logo Iterations</strong> <br>
<p class="bodytext">I took inspiration for the look and feel of
	the application from what I literally would like my users to do, take items out of their carts. Buyers tend to leave things in their carts
	so in this way taking items out will prevent them from buying. </p>
