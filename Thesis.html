<strong class="smalltitle">Concept</strong> <br>
<p class="bodytext"> I created a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en">chrome extension</a>
	that focuses as an intervention/strategy for online compulsive buyers to assist them with their decision-making.</p><br><br><br>


<strong class="smalltitle">Context</strong>
	<p class="bodytext">When shopping alone online, no one tells you to think before you buy. Online stores
		such as Amazon have the quickest process from adding an item to your cart, typing your shipping information, and hitting submit.
		Amazon even added one-click buy to make this easy. Stores like this are not thinking of consumer needs, they are making the buying process
		QUICK so the consumer does not even have time to think. With this, my goal is to focus on the consumer or customer needs and assist them with
		making good choices through online interfaces that are too quick.<br><br>

		How can I make impulse buyers stop and think before they buy?<br>
		How can I design an interface that that is not intrusive to their every day lives? <br>

	<strong class="smalltitle">How can AI transform the style quiz by learning about users?</strong> <br>


<p class="bodytext">I challenged the aspect of the style profile by understanding how AI could learn much more quickly about personal style compared to doing the quiz yourself.
Using <a href= "https://www.ibm.com/watson/campaign/?leadspace=anthem&S_PKG=AW&cm_mmc=Search_Google-_-Corporate+Advertising_Pillars-_-NA_US-_-ibm+watson_Exact_AW&cm_mmca1=000027HR&cm_mmca2=10006704&cm_mmca7=9004236&cm_mmca8=kwd-300463098144&cm_mmca9=0b2e7a12-7efa-4df9-bf72-1d9676afb9ee&cm_mmca10=289917604538&cm_mmca11=e&mkwid=0b2e7a12-7efa-4df9-bf72-1d9676afb9ee|447|134075&cvosrc=ppc.google.ibm%20watson&cvo_campaign=000027HR&cvo_crid=289917604538&Matchtype=e&gclid=Cj0KCQjwidPcBRCGARIsALM--eNzZVw7_VTgP756uSmnlDYYJbwoX1VDeAe3kAnUIBmCRoWtrRZOrAEaAnSZEALw_wcB">IBM Watson</a> will also feel more comfortable, because you will feel as if you are having an effortless conversation with a friend.
'Stylists can get a better understanding of what the customer likes and this will leave the customer feeling
good, and not so frustrated by wasting time taking the onboarding quiz.</p>


<br><br>

<strong class="smalltitle">Problem Statement</strong> <br>


<p class="bodytext">
I created a interface for the Stitch Fix style quiz using IBM Watson that feels personal and will leave the customer feeling like the interaction was painless.</p>
<br><br>

<strong class="smalltitle">Persona</strong> <br>


<p class="bodytext">
Based on my research and analysis, I created a persona.</p>

<img class="projectImgWatson" src="images/Brianna.png"><br><br>
<br><br>
<strong class="smalltitle">Storyboard, How it Works</strong> <br><br>
<p class="bodytext">Instead of the user getting frustrated by a long quiz, they will have an easy conversation with a chat bot around their personal style and measurements. Below is the journey that the user will take to use IBM Watson with Stitch Fix during a day they can't find anything to wear.
An effective way to progress was to sketch out the scenarios of how a potential user would interact with my product.  </p>

<br>
<br><br>
<strong class="smalltitle">Mapping the Conversation</strong> <br><br>
<p class="bodytext">Chatbots, when applied to the right industry can be incredibly helpful. With <a href= "https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/">Watson Assistant</a>, Watson will classify the intelligent personal style of the customer using a mathematical filtering technique.
	Watson technology will store your personal data, and overtime will get to know your personal style even better.
