<p class="bodytext">  MyScraper is a screen-based experience designed for the Skyscraper Museum in Manhattan, New York. The visitors of the museum will design their own skyscrapers with using this application. MyScraper aims to create a basic understanding of design parameters of skyscrapers with targeting the children and their families as the main audience. Several screens are located at the core of the museum for attracting visitors’ attention. At the end of the experience, the application evaluates the participant’s design step by step accordingly parameters that have an impact on revenue, publicity, and energy efficiency.</p>

    <strong class="smalltitle">Research</strong> <br> <br>



<p class="bodytext"> Our team visited Skyscraper Museum and their website to analyze and document the existing design of the museum. Even though the museum had interesting content and historical information on their website, there was a lack of an overall aesthetic. In addition, the museum did not offer any interactive or efficient digital experiences.</p>

  <strong class="smalltitle">Design Process</strong> <br>


<p class="bodytext">  Our team wanted to create an experience for visitors that would help them to understand the architectual design process of skyscrapers. During our observations, we recognized that there were a few children that seemed very impressed by the skyscraper models. So, we chose children and their parents as our target audience. Then we discussed the flow of the user experience and spatial design. The steps of the experience based on the actual design process of an architectural project. <br><br>Participant:<br>
1 | Chooses one of the areas they want to build.<br>
2 | Learns about the context (pop-up information: the history of the neighborhood or other buildings)<br>
3 | Decides the number of floors with help of an abstract structure.<br>
4 | Decides where to locate vertical circulation elements like elevators and stairs.<br> 
5 | Picks the materials for surfaces for facades.<br>
6 | Adds more elements on the building like solar panels, trees, vertical garden etc.</p>
